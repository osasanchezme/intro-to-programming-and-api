## Welcome to the Offical SkyCiv Introduction to Programming Course

In this course we will take you from no programming experience to using our world class analysis and design api.

### How is this course different

Too often programming courses use poor examples such as looping through an array of people's names and printing them to the console. As Structural Engineers, we understand this isn't ideal to help these foreign concepts sink in. 

Instead, we are going to take you from the very beginning using real life engineering examples. Want to see how an array, loops or if statements could be used in a Structural Engineering situation? We'll show you how.
