# skyciv api object

This lesson will teach you how to use the [SkyCiv API docs](https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs) to create a request object.

The input object that you must supply in the request is comprised of three components.

1. The `auth` object which is required.
2. The `options` object which is optional.
3. The `functions` array which must contain at least one item.

Check out what values can be assigned to these keys [here](https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs/the-request-object).
