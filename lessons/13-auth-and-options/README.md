# auth and options

In this lesson we look at creating the [`auth`](https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs/the-request-object#auth) and [`options`](https://skyciv.com/api/v3/docs/the-request-object#options) objects by following the documentation.

We'll then start to compile our API object which we will add to in the next couple of videos.
